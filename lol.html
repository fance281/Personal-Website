        <p>League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. 
            Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its
             release in October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows 
             and macOS. In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten 
             players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting 
             experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy 
             base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.</p>
